# SQL Examples

Welcome to the SQL Examples repository! This repository contains a collection of SQL queries and their respective questions, which I worked on during my database course in my faculty. Each set of questions and answers is organized into folders for easy navigation.

## Repository Structure

#### The repository is structured as follows:


- **FolderX/**: Each folder represents a set of questions and answers from a particular lesson or topic in the course.
  - `questions.txt`: Contains the questions for the respective lesson or topic.
  - `answers.sql`: Contains the SQL queries answering the questions in `questions.txt`.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate to the folder**: Browse through the folders to find the topic or lesson you are interested in.
2. **View the questions**: Open the `questions.txt` file to see the questions.
3. **Review the answers**: Open the `answers.sql` file to see the SQL queries that answer the questions.
